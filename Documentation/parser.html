            <h2>Setting Up the FX Parser</h2>
            <h3>What is FX Parser</h3>
            <p>
                The FX Parser is a handy example of how to use the FX class. It is a PHP program that will show you how
                to setup FX for your particular data source. What FX Parser does after that, is give you a robust and
                interactive outline of the data array as it comes back from your database server: it parses the returned
                array into a JavaScript driven HTML viewer.
            </p>
            <h4>Installing the FX Class and FX Parser</h4>
            <p>
                The FX Parser is distributed with the FX class from <a href="https://github.com/yodarunamok/fxphp">
                github</a>. Make sure you have downloaded the latest version of this distribution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The FX Class does not have an installer, it is simply in a folder called &quot;FX&quot; or
                &quot;fxphp&quot;. For consistency, go ahead and rename the directory &quot;FX&quot;, if it isn&apos;t
                already. To install the FX class put its folder at the root level of your site. Your site should now
                have the path www.your_domain.com/FX/.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
                Although installing FX as described above is a great way to get started (especially with a development
                setup), at some point you&apos;ll likely want to move the FX directory somewhere more secure &mdash; at
                the very least, the configuration data is likely quite sensitive. For now, concentrate on becoming more
                familiar with FX.php and web development. There are more details about this in the
                <a href="best_practices.html">Best Practices</a> documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the FX folder are documentation, helper files, and of course the FX Parser. The FX Parser
                resides in its own folder called &quot;fx_parser&quot; at the root level of the FX folder. With your
                favorite text editor or IDE open up the document &quot;index.php&quot; inside the &quot;fx_parser&quot;
                folder and you&apos;ll be ready to go!
            </p>
            <h4>Recap of what you are about to do</h4>
            <p>
                When you become familiar with PHP and the FX class you will be typing your own PHP code, querying
                against a live databases, and building dynamic web pages. But right now, we&apos;re going to show you how
                that&apos;s done using the FX Parser. We will edit some PHP code in the &quot;index.php&quot; document
                and then load the page to see the results.
            </p>
            <h3>Editing the FX Parser &quot;index.php&quot;</h3>
            <p>
                The FX Parser is a document call &quot;index.php&quot; inside the &quot;fx_parser&quot; folder at the
                root level of the &quot;FX&quot; folder. Open &quot;index.php&quot; in your favorite text editor.
            </p>
            <p>We will be editing the lines of code near the top between the lines marked</p>
            <pre class="code">
# BEGINNING OF USER CODE HERE

....

# END OF USER CODE HERE</pre>
            <p>
                The code you need to modify is well documented. These lines of code are good examples of how you will
                use FX in your own web solutions. What follows are step-by-step instructions of how to modify these
                lines of code so that FX Parser works, and you can see how to use the FX Class.
            </p>
            <h4>Configuring Your Environment</h4>
            <p>
                The first step is to set up the configuration variables at the top of the <span class="code">USER
                CODE</span> section.  The comments here will walk you through what each item does.  For now, leave the
                <span class="code">$recordsPerPage</span> variable at its initial setting.
            </p>
            <pre class="code">
#   First off, change the values below to match how your database server is
#   set up. Keeping things together this way, and using variables, makes it
#   easier to find things and change them later.
#
#   Your database server's address may be an IP address like "192.168.1.12",
#   or it may be a hostname like "fms.your-domain.com".
    $serverAddress = 'your_server_address';

#   The port on which the database server is listening, usually:
#   - 80 for FileMaker Server
#   - 3306 for MySQL
#   - 5432 for PostgreSQL
    $serverPort = 80;

#   The type of server being accessed. For FileMaker, the XML has not changed
#   since version 7 (though you may use FMPro13, for example, if you prefer.)
#   You can also use mysql, postgresql, etc. See the functions documentation
#   for more details.
    $serverType = 'FMPro7';

#   The username and password combination for your database. In FileMaker,
#   this user will need the fmxml extended privilege (note that FX.php does NOT
#   use the php extended privilege in FileMaker.)
    $username = 'your_username';
    $password = 'your_password';

#   The name of your database and layout (table for SQL data sources) are
#   specified here, as well as how many records (rows) you would like returned
#   at once (this example limits the result record set to 3)
    $databaseName = 'your_database';
    $layoutOrSqlTable = 'your_layout';
    $recordsPerPage = 3;</pre>
            <p>
                Once you&apos;ve set these to match your environment, you&apos;re ready for the next step. If a value
                is a string (that is, text), be sure to enclose it in quotes!
            </p>
            <h4>Instantiating and Configuring the FX Object</h4>
            <p>
                The next line of code needs to tell PHP where the FX object code is located. You do this by using the
                <span class="code">include</span> or <span class="code">require</span> statement(s).
            </p>
            <pre class="code">
require_once('../FX.php');</pre>
            <p>
                With this line, we’ve loaded the FX object so if PHP receives any calls to FX functions they can be
                executed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we need to get FX going. This is done be creating an FX object. Once we create an FX object then we
                can start talking to it and telling it what to do.
            </p>
            <pre class="code">
$query = new FX($serverAddress, $serverPort, $serverType);</pre>
            <p>
                No tricks here. You are saying that the variable <span class="code">$query</span> will be an FX object.
                When creating the FX object called <span class="code">$query</span>, three variables that you set
                above are used: <span class="code">$serverAddress</span> contains the address of your database server,
                <span class="code">$serverPort</span> is the port number on which your database server is listening, and
                <span class="code">$serverType</span> is the type of data source you are using. More information on this
                is found in the <a href="functions.html">FX functions documentation</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that we have an &quot;instance&quot; of FX, we can work with it and eventually tell it to give us
                the results of a find of our choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two important lines come next, one deals with authentication and the other with the database. First,
                authentication:
            </p>
            <pre class="code">$query->SetDBUserPass($username, $password);</pre>
            <p>
                Of course your web available databases should be protected with user names and passwords. Notice the
                syntax here:
            <pre class="code">$query->SetDBPassword ...</pre>
            <p>
                To use the functions in an FX class object, we first type the object&apos;s name, <span
                class="code">$query</span>, then we use the symbols <span class="code">-&gt;</span>, then we type the
                function. This syntax for calling object functions and setting object parameters is consistent
                throughout the object oriented programming of PHP and will be used when working with the FX class.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, we need to tell <span class="code">$query</span>, which database file to use and which layout to
                work from.  Again, this information is contained in the variables that you prepared above.
            </p>
            <pre class="code">$query->SetDBData($databaseName, $layoutOrSqlTable, $recordsPerPage);</pre>
            <p>
                The SetDBData() function is used here. The first two parameters are your file name and layout name
                respectively. The last parameter <span class="code">$recordsPerPage</span> is optional &mdash; you
                could completely remove it and the preceding comma, and your code would still work (though you might
                get more records at once than you&apos;d wanted since it specifies how many records to display in the
                result.)
            <h4>Review of our New FX Object</h4>
            <p>
                So far we have told PHP where to find the FX related code by using a require statement. We then created
                an FX object called <span class="code">$query</span>, passing the server address, port number and
                datasource type as parameters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the FX object was created we called the two basic and essential functions:
                <span class="code">SetDBUserPass()</span> and <span class="code">SetDBData()</span>. PHP now knows
                about FX and can execute its code. FX now knows about your database server, it&apos;s port, username,
                password, database name, and layout (or SQL table) name.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don’t forget to make sure the account you use for this job has access to the database and layout or table
                that was specified.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are now at exactly the same point in a FileMaker&reg; database that a user would be if they just
                opened up a file, logged in, and navigated to a specific layout. What we&apos;re going to do now is
                perform a find using that layout.
            </p>
            <h4>Performing the Find</h4>
            <p>
                In FileMaker&reg; Pro, you would perform a find by entering find mode first, and then typing the
                criteria in the desired field(s). With FX it&apos;s even easier because you don&apos;t have to enter
                find mode, you just start entering find criteria right into the fields. This is done with the
                <span class="code">AddDBParam()</span> function. Only one <span class="code">AddDBParam()</span>
                function per field &mdash; there are some <a href="functions.html">FX functions</a> that you may prefer
                as you become more experienced.
            </p>
            <pre class="code">$query->AddDBParam('your_field_name', 'your_find_criteria');</pre>
            <p>
                Again, your parameters for this function are strings, so you will need to enclose them in quotes. To
                search on criteria in more than one field you just keep adding <span class="code">AddDBParam()</span>
                lines.
            </p>
            <pre class="code">
$query->AddDBParam('your_field_name2', 'your_find_criteria2');
$query->AddDBParam('your_field_name3', 'your_find_criteria3');</pre>
            <p>
                In FileMaker&reg; Pro, the logical OR can be added to a find by creating new find requests. In SQL, you
                would separate your find criteria with the keyword &quot;OR&quot;. To do this with FX, you simply call
                the <span class="code"><a href="functions_configure.html#SetLogicalOR">SetLogicalOR()</a></span> function,
                like so:
            </p>
            <pre class="code">$query->SetLogicalOR();</pre>
            <p>
                This <span class="code">SetLogicalOR()</span> line creates a new Find Request. Just like being in
                FileMaker&reg; Find Mode and then selecting &quot;New Request&quot; from the menu.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can now populate the fields in this request by using the <span class="code">AddDBParam()</span>
                function, one line per field, just like you did on the first request. When you are satisfied with the
                criteria setup for your find you ready to perform the find.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
                Some of you may be saying at this point: &quot;but what if I want a find that <strong>combines</strong>
                logical AND and logical OR?&quot;  There&apos;s an FX function for that, but it&apos;s complex enough to
                be outside of the scope of this basic &quot;getting started&quot; documentation. It&apos;s called
                <span class="code">FindQuery_AND()</span> and you can see more about it in the
                <a href="functions.html#FindQuery_AND">functions documentation</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Actually performing the find is the easiest part. This is done with the function FMFind() with one
                important difference. You need to use a new variable for the last function to work: a new variable that
                will hold the results of your search. If you just type
            </p>
            <pre class="code">$query-&gt;FMFind();</pre>
            <p>
                it will indeed perform a find, but it also wants to give you an array of the results. You need to
                define a variable to hold that array.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, a proper find is executed with code like this,
            </p>
            <pre class="code">$queryResult = $query-&gt;FMFind();</pre>
            <p>
                and that is exactly what you see in the FX Parser. Please remember that the code
            </p>
            <pre class="code">$queryResult = $query-&gt;FMFind();</pre>
            <p>
                must not be changed in the FX Parser. The Parser will work with an array call $queryResult and if you
                change the name of that variable... oops... it breaks.
